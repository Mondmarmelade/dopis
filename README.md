# Dopis

Dopis is an email client designed to sort emails by category, sender, and content. <br>
Nowadays, hardly anyone uses email as a method of communication anymore. It has become a place to receive adverts, newsletters, or product updates. Dopis is designed to create clarity and structure in this mess, and to help you organize your emails.
